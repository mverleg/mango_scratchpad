# Concurrent Indexable Skiplist
#
# Implement indexable skip list in Mango to showcase some advanced features:
#
# * Generics
# * CAS operations
# * Memory pools
# * Double-linked list (maybe)
# * Conditional compile (for map+set, maybe)
#
# Note that some compromises or assumptions may be necessary - concurrent exists and indexable exists,
# but not sure about the combination.
